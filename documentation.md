We will be developing and posting relevant documentation for developers, administrators, and users alike. Until those documents begin to appear, we wanted to give you an idea of some that are on their way. Much of this will be directly linked from the corresponding components' wiki pages, but for now we wanted to aggregate all of it on one page.

## For Users

* [About Smart Cards]({{ '/documentation/cards/' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
* [About Smart Card Readers]({{ '/documentation/readers/' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
* [About Identities on the Smart Cards]({{ '/documentation/identities/' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
* [About PKI on macOS]({{ '/documentation/pki-on-macos/' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

## For Everyone

* Smart Card Services Architecture Overview
* Component Architecture Overview

## For Developers

* [Instructions for building a TokenD or PCSC framework]({{ '/documentation/building/' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
* [Guidance for building a reader driver]({{ '/documentation/driver/' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
* How to submit your work to this project

## For Administrators

* Smart cards supported
* Smart card readers supported (w/CCID driver and third-party drivers)
* Configuring a macOS system to use the various smart cards for applications
* Extending the use of smart cards to third-party applications

and so, so much more...
