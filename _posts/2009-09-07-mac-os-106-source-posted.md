Source Code for the SmartCard Services that shipped in Mac OS X 10.6.0 have been posted!

Now that Mac OS X 10.6.0 has been released by Apple on August 28, 2009, we were able to post the corresponding source code to our project for immediate access and development.

### 64-Bit Development

Keep in mind that Mac OS X 10.6 ***"Snow Leopard"*** requires many of you to shift to full 64-bit development environments depending on what layer of the OS your solution targets. If you have been leveraging the **darwinbuild** process, be sure to acquire an updated copy before proceeding with development here.

### Source Code Postings

Source Code releases have now been posted under a new directory of **"/releases"**. From this point forward, we will always post new source from Apple under the appropriate Mac OS X release name as in:

* [/releases](https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/browser/releases "Releases")
  * [/Apple](https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/browser/releases/Apple "Apple Releases")
    * [/OSX-10.5.6](https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/browser/releases/Apple/OSX-10.5.6 "Apple Mac OS X 10.5.6")
    * [/OSX-10.6.0](https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/browser/releases/Apple/OSX-10.6.0 "Apple Mac OS X 10.6.0")

All releases coming directly from the work here will be posted under this new directory as well. **SmartCardServices** will be posted with their own release sequence name.

* [/releases](https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/browser/releases "Releases")
  * [/SCS](https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/browser/releases/SCS "SCS Releases")
