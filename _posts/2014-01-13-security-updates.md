We added a new project section, **[Security Updates](https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/security),** to the left side navigation bar for explanation of security updates. SmartCardServices **Security Update IDs** will use the following naming convention:

**SCSSU-YYYYNN**

* **SCSSU** - SmartCardServices Security Update
* **YYYY** - The calendar year the update was included
* **NN** - The sequental update for the calendar year

First SCSSSU has been included in the SmartCardServices v2.0 release and was identified as: **SCSSU-201401**.
