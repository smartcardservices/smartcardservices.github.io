<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">**All Installers and Tokend bundles from this project are now digitally signed.  **</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Older installers (ie. for v10.10, v10.9, ...) have been re-posted, incremented to v2.1.2, and digitally signed. Their respective installation locations will remain as they were on the respective OS releases.  The repsective SHA-256 hash has been generated and noted on the download page which replaces the previous SHA-1 hash postings.</span>
