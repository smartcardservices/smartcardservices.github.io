Updated Installer (v2.1.2) posted for OS X El Capitan v10.11.

The previous Installers (prior to v2.1.2) posted for El Capitan had been causing some users problems when running the installer. We have tracked the problem down to an issue with the content/text formatting embedded in the **Welcome** and **Read Me** panels of the installer. To avoid the problem for everyone, we have removed all text formatting from the installer and have reposted the installer for all to consume.
